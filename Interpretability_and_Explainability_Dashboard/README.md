# Model Interpretability and Explainability Dashboard

This project demonstrates a Flask-based web application that allows users to visualize model activation maps before and after optimizations like pruning and quantization. The tool supports both PyTorch and JAX, allowing users to see the impact of these optimizations on a computer vision model. Additionally, the dashboard allows users to select from different PyTorch models and choose which LLM model to use for generating explainability reports.

## Features
- **Model Selection and Visualization:** Upload an image and visualize activation maps. Choose between different PyTorch models (e.g., ResNet18, ResNet34, VGG16, DenseNet121) for visualization and optimization.
- **Quantization and Pruning Options:** Apply model quantization and pruning using JAX, allowing comparisons of pre- and post-optimization effects.
- **LM-Generated Explainability Reports:**  Get detailed explainability reports powered by LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) to better understand how the applied optimizations impact the model’s behavior.

## Usage instructions
1. Upload an image using the provided form.
2. Choose from various PyTorch models (ResNet18, ResNet34, VGG16, DenseNet121) for visualization.
3. Select whether to apply pruning, quantization, or both (compression) using JAX.
4. Choose the LLM model (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) for generating the explainability report.
3. View the original and optimized activation maps side-by-side, along with the detailed LLM-generated explainability report.
4. Experiment with different settings to observe how model optimization affects interpretability and performance.
